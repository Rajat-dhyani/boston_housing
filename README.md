# Boston Housing Prices
*Udacity - Machine learning Nano Degree Program : Project-1*

## Project Overview
*This is second project in the series of the projects listed in Udacity- Machine Learning Nano Degree Program.*

In this project, i have applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I have first explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I have properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. I have then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. Thus enabling me  to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I have tested this optimal model on a new sample and compared the predicted selling price to my statistics.

## Project Highlights
*This project is designed to get me acquainted to working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn.*

  ● **Achieved accuracy of 90.02 % .**
  
Things i have learnt by completing this project:
* How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
* How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
* How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
* How to evaluate a model’s performance on unseen data using previous data.
